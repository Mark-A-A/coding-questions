Typeahead Input
The objective for this question is to create a typeahead input with the given project structure. A `cities` variable holds an Array of cities, and we want to create an input that, when typed in, will display a list of matches in a ul/li below the input.

 

Basic styles are provided, and adhering to the specified class names is required for the test suite to be able to gauge correctness.

 

Requirements:

- Your input should have the class name 'App__input'

- The input should be rendered by default

- Your list (ul) of matches should use the class name 'App__list'

- The list should only be shown when a match is present and the input is focused

- The list should ignore case, but respect whitespace, even leading whitespace

- The list should be sorted alphabetically

- The list should close when you click outside of the input or the list

-  Your list items (li) should use the class name 'App__listItem'

- Clicking a list item should populate the input with the clicked items value and close the list

- The matched portion of the list item label should be wrapped in a span with the className 'App__listItem-highlight'

- A match must start with the first character of the list item content ("foo" would not be a match for "oo")
